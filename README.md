## 🎯 The Problem

> Students often book separate rides or food orders to the same destinations/restaurants, leading to extra cost and wastage.

Our challenge was to build a platform for students to share rides and group food orders easily, with add-ons for group chat, split payments, live tracking, and verified profiles.

## 💡 Our Solution

**wheel2gether** is a web-based platform designed for college campuses. It directly connects students who are heading to the same destination or ordering from the same restaurant.

By creating a simple and trusted network, our platform helps students:
* **Save Money:** Split ride fares and food delivery fees.
* **Reduce Waste:** Consolidate multiple orders into one, reducing delivery traffic and packaging.
* **Build Community:** Connect with fellow students in a safe, verified environment.

## ✨ Key Features

Our platform successfully implements the core requirements of the problem statement:

* **🛡️ Secure Authentication:** Users can create an account and log in. This ensures that only verified students from the community can access the platform.
* **🏠 Main Dashboard:** After logging in, users are presented with a clear choice to either "Share Ride" or "Share Food."
* **🚗 Ride Pooling:** Users can post a ride they are planning, specifying source, destination, time, and cost per seat. Other students can then see this "Available Ride" and join it.
* **🍔 Group Food Orders:** Similar to ride pooling, users can post a food order they are about to place. Other students can join in to split the delivery fee and meet minimum order requirements.
* **🤝 Real-time Group Management:** The system updates in real-time. As seen in the screenshots, when a passenger joins a ride, their name  appears under the "Passengers Joined" list for the host to see.
